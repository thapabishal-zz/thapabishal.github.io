<p class="post-content">
In 1991, Java was named as <b>Oak</b> programming language, which was created by James Gosling for set-top box project while he was working for Sun-micro system. He created this new language (Oak) to
 solve the issue of memory management and portability. It was named after the Oak tree which stood outside his office. Later in 1994
Oak was renamed to Java. Most of the specification from Oak language was implemented of Java 1.0. </p> 

<p class="post-content">
During 1994, the market of World Wide Web (WWW) was growing and the project Oak was about to shutdown so, James Gosling and his team decided
to focus in the internet market. They want to make something that could run over the internet and also replace the traditional platform based software. 
They came up with an idea of portable applet program which could run over the browser on any platform. Applet is program that can run inside the web browser
on the client side which make web site more dynamic, it was the modern JavaScript of that time. Due to the portability, after that many browser was built with the applet support. They decided
to rename this new feature Oak programming language to bypass the trademark issues.

<p class="post-content">
Now, One name had to be decided to rename Oak programming language to bypass the trademark issue to introduce new applet support feature in the Oak programming language.
Marketing team came up different name list like <i>Silk</i>, <i>Lyrics</i>, <i>Java </i> ... etc. Random person from the team choose the name <b>Java</b> so it is unknown who chose the name.

Today Java has been the language of choice, since it is used in many application that are used on a day-to-day basis from big data technologies to small organization.
 Few people would disagree with me if I say, <b>"Java is all around"</b>.
