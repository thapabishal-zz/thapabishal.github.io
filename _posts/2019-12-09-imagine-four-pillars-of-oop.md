<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<p class="post-content">
Imagine, A small child gets money from his father. The child knows that fathers can provide money, but
 that small child doesn't know the complexity father faced to make that money. Here, It is not necessary for a
 little child to know the information or complexity faced by his father. Like the real world, In OOP abstraction means hiding
  the implementation and showing only the relevant information needed for the users. Java has partial and full abstraction.
  Partial abstraction can be achieved with abstract class and total abstraction can be achieved with the interface. Next, we have 
  encapsulation which is comparable concept with abstraction, but with little difference, don't get confused.

<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
<p class="post-content">

Imagine, You have lot's of money ðŸ˜‰. You don't want others to access your money so you put in the 
bank or other safe place where you can only access it. Encapsulation is like protecting your money from others access. 
In OOP when we try to secure object data, we use the term encapsulation.Technically, encapsulation is hiding  data or state of
 the object which is not accessible by other outside that object but can be used my internal method. Access modifier like <i> private </i> 
 helps to hide the data or state 
Of an object. If there is a need to change the state of an object public method is provided.

<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p class="post-content">

Imagine, a fixed-line telephone and modern smartphone. Smartphones derived the property to make calls from a fixed - line telephone which is
 called inheritance. Technically, Inheritance is a methodology which allows a class to adopt the state or behavior of another class which are
  also known as child and parent class. There are different type of inheritance like <i> single inheritance, multiple inheritance, multi-level 
  inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, hybrid inheritanceI </i> but  Java doesn't support hybrid and multiple inheritance. 
  In Java <i> extends </i> keyword is used to to implement inheritance concept we use this concept for reusability.Inheritance also shows 
  the relationship between classes. Java uses "Is-A" relationships for inheritance. It is a tightly coupled relationship which means, 
  the changing parent class behavior impacts the child class. 

</p>

<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
<p class="post-content">

Imagine, When you are with friends and when you are with your dad you have different behavior.
 You are the same guy, but you have different behavior. In OOP, polymorphism is the way to make action in different 
 ways with same name or same method signature. In Java, we can achieve polymorphism with static/compile-time (method overloading)  and 
 dynamic way (method overriding).  An object that can pass multiple tests instanceof or "is-A" relationship test is known as polymorphic 
 object which means the object has more than one form. The biggest advantage of polymorphism is to decouple the client class and implementation.
